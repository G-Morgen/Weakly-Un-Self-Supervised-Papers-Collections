# Weakly Supervised / Unsupervised / Self Supervised Paper Collections
This repo is to collect the interesting papers in learning with less supervision.
## 1. Weakly Supervised Methods:
As Zhi-Hua Zhou claimed, Weakly supervised methods can be distinguished into 3 kinds:
1. Incomplete supervision, where only a subset of training data is given with labels.
2. Inexact supervision, where the training data are given with only coarse-grained labels.
3. Inaccuate supervision, where the given labels are not always ground-truth

### 1.1 Incomplete supervision ( Semi-Supervisied )


### 1.2 Inexact supervision ( Multiple Instance Learning )
#### 1.2.1 Generic Methods
1. Attention-based Deep Instance Learning, ICML 2018.
#### 1.2.2 in Object Detection
1. Instance-level label propagation with multi-instance learning, IJCAI 17
2. C-MIL: Continuation Multiple Instance Learning for Weakly Supervised Object Detection, CVPR 19
3. Towards precise end-end Weakly supervised object detection network, ICCV 19
#### 1.2.3 in Temporal Action Localization

#### 1.2.4 in Image Classification

### 1.3 Inaccurate supervision ( Label Noise Learning )
