# 1. Weakly Supervised Methods:
As Zhi-Hua Zhou claimed, Weakly supervised methods can be distinguished into 3 kinds:
1. Incomplete supervision, where only a subset of training data is given with labels.
2. Inexact supervision, where the training data are given with only coarse-grained labels.
3. Inaccuate supervision, where the given labels are not always ground-truth
